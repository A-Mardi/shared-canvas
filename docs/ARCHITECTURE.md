# Architecture notes

## Current scaffold

The web application displays project status and planned milestones. A loopback-only HTTP service exposes a scaffold health response at `/api/health`. It does not implement product APIs.

## Intended responsibilities

The Go service will own rooms and persistence. The browser will own editing and local state. Yjs integration and synchronization semantics are planned, not implemented.

## Development decisions

- Keep each component independently buildable.
- Add dependencies only when a concrete feature needs them.
- Keep long-running work out of the UI thread.
- Define cancellation and failure behavior alongside the main workflow.
- Measure performance before making optimization claims.
- Use existing libraries where appropriate and attribute their contribution.

These notes describe an initial direction. Record significant changes here as the implementation develops.
